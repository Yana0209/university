# Task2

## Overview
This project involves creating a feature branch for implementing TypeScript in a web project. The main tasks include setting up a TypeScript environment, adding an HTML/CSS template, and integrating JavaScript interactivity.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Branch Creation**: A new branch named `feature/tsconfig` was created in the existing Git repository.
2. **Template Addition**: A pre-made HTML/CSS template was added to the `feature/tsconfig` branch.
3. **TypeScript Setup**: TypeScript was installed in the project as outlined in the course materials.
4. **JavaScript Interactivity**: Interactive features were added to the template, including:
   - Modal window functionality
   - Basic animations
   - Fetching and displaying data from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/`
5. **TypeScript Code**: All JavaScript code was written in a TypeScript file, using primitive types. The TypeScript file is configured to compile to JavaScript.
6. **HTML Integration**: The compiled JavaScript file was linked in the HTML template.
7. **Final Push**: All changes were committed and pushed to the `feature/tsconfig` branch.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the integration of TypeScript into a web development workflow, along with the addition of interactivity to a static HTML template.
